MUSHRoom
-- 0.2 "boletus"

MUSHRoom is a tool to create and host a MUSH.
You will need python3 to launch the server.

A MUSH is a text-mode game, the server will be reachable by telnet, netcat,
and other very simple TCP/IP text clients. The default port is 1337.
You can change it in the `config.py`

Launching the server:
--------------------

```
python3 server.py
```


Connecting to the game:
----------------------

```
nc hostname 1337
```


If you want better handling of typed commands, with history, give a look at
