 - some barriers, especially to direct code execution
 - extension of the fw:
   . a bunch of utility methods (oemit, aemit...)
 - automation: separate thread that performs registered actions at regular intervals
 - global class register?
   . we need to be able to get a list of available world classes
   . they should be hierarchically organized
   . some kind of automated loading
- command object
   . that would contain the command name, action, error messages, help topic
